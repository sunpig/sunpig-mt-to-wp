# sunpig-mt-to-wp

Notes, instructions, and scripts for moving sunpig.com from Movable Type to Wordpress

## Intro

As of 1 January 2014, sunpig.com is using Movable Type Pro version 5.14 with
Community Pack 1.83, and Professional Pack 1.63. The MT installation has two users
(@evilrooster and @sunpig), and five blogs:

* [Evilrooster Crows](http://sunpig.com/abi/)
* [Legends of the Sun Pig](http://sunpig.com/martin/)
* defunct [Quick Reviews](http://sunpig.com/martin/quickreviews/2009/)
* defunct [Bunny Tails](http://sunpig.com/bunnytails/)
* defunct, sidebar blog [Something Nice](http://sunpig.com/martin/somethingnice/2010/)

The goal is to move these blogs to self-hosted Wordpress 3.8 on the same server.

Reasons for the migration:

First of all, Movable Type fails two of my three tests for choosing a piece of (open source) software:

* Is it well documented? (yes)
* Is it under active development (no, at least not in its open source version)
* Does it have an active and supportive user community (not any more)

I still like its architectural model of static publishing, and (partly because of that) it has
a great security record, which is important if you're running your own server. I've been using MT
since version 1, and I've clung to it for sentimental and pseudo-practical reasons ("I know the
templating language really well!") for a long time, but the online world is a much different place now,
and the fact is that compared to all other avenues for writing online, MT 5's interface is
poor, and I dislike using it. As a result, I don't. I blogged less in 2013 than in any previous year.

[OpenMelody](http://openmelody.com/) was a fork of the open source version of MT 4, but it seems
to be dead now.

I was considering using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is a modern static site generator:
write posts in your text editor, run a site generator from the command line, and `rsync` the generated
html files to your server. This has lots of good points: it generates static files, and it plugs
directly into my standard text editor workflow â€” with version control! This is great if you're a
programmer and always have access to a machine with a command line. Not so great if
`bundle exec jekyll build` makes you twitchy, or if you like the idea of occasionally posting
something from your phone. Also, no matter how you slice it, comments end up as a crazy hack.
I can see myself using jekyll for other projects, just not for our main blogs.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) looks interesting and new and shiny, but also: node + sqlite. Really?
And I mistrust an open source project that has a "sign up" link on its home page, but not a
"download".

[Drupal](https://drupal.org/) would probably do the job, but my impression is (perhaps incorrectly)
that it is more geared towards *sites* rather than *blogs*.

So... Wordpress. Big community, well documented, under active development. Used to have a bad rep
for security, but is a lot better than it used to be, and since version 3.7 even features an
automatic update process to apply maintenance and security patches. It also has well-established
guidelines and practices for hardening an installation. It's "the standard" these days. I have a
general preference for "off-piste" solutions, but sometimes I just want to go with something that
"just works". Mostly.


## Factors to consider

I'd prefer as little downtime as possible, but I can live with a few hours. That means I don't have to
script and rehearse the migration in exhaustive detail.

I'm assuming that the new wp_* tables will live side-by-side with the old mt_* tables in the same
MySQL database, at least for the duration of the migration. This makes copying data easy, and means
I can do JOIN statements between the old and the new.

We haven't used the asset management features of MT very much, which means that pretty much all of
our data is stored as text in the database - we don't have to worry about uploaded assets and linkages between
the db and the file system.

Maintaining permalinks for individual posts is a must-have. Maintaining permalinks for comments on entries
is just a nice-to-have.

We only have a few blogs (5) and a few registered authors (4), because we never made much use of MT's
user registration system. With these numbers, it's simple enough to manually create the matching blogs
and users in WP, and then copy data across to them. If we had more registered users, I'd probably
want to script their creation, and spend a lot more time matching up users and entries.

I don't care whether posts appear as duplicates in RSS readers after the migration - this means I can
can just make sure that the GUID for each post in the wp_posts table is unique, but it doesn't have to
match anything in the old system.

The charset the mt_* tables in our database use is `latin1`. The wp_* tables use a utf8 charset.

I can cope with a small loss of fidelity in things like categories and tags.
